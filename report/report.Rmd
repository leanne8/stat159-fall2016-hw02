##Abstract
This homework is to reproduce the analysis from Section 3.1 of Ch 3 Linear Regression from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (by James et al). The homework will analyze the advertising dataset with linear regression and summary statistics.

##Introduction
From the dataset advertising, I can reproduce the simple linear regression with TV and sales. The simple linear regression can predict a quantitative response Y based on predictor variable X. With the modeling, we can tell if there is a relationship exists between TV advertising and Sales. If there exists a positive relationship, the marketing team can decide to increase Tv advertising budget to promote their sales. 

##Data 
The dataset *Advertising.csv* comes from _"http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv_. It consists for TV, Radio, Newspaper and Sales columns. The structure of the columns are stored in numeric vectors. 

##Methodology
By using the simple linear regression, we can predict the future sales based on the amount of TV advertising.  
The simple linear regression equation is the following: 
```
Y = A + Bx + e
```
Y = Sales
A = Intercept
Bx = TV advertising 
e = error 

In R command, we can fit a linear regression model by using the *lm()* command. 
The null hypothesis is there does not exist a relationship between TV ad and sales. The alternative hypothesis is that there exists a relationship between TV ad and sales. 
##Results

```
load('./data/regression.RData')
library(xtable)
reg_table <- xtable(reg_summary)
reg_table
```

##Conclusions
This homework shows the relationship between TV advertising and sales. There exists a positive correlation between the TV advertising and sales. In the future, we can apply the same model to radio and newspaper.
